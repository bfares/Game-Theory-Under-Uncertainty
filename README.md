# Game-Theory-Under-Uncertainty

Ignorance within game theory, reflected as uncertainty towards a game's outcome,
is examined from a Bayesian point of view. We explore a solution concept that is
based on recent statistical research in imprecise probabilities and de Finetti's common-
knowledge property, which utilizes bets to assess beliefs. The resulting model will allow
players to be uncertain about their initial preferences towards an outcome and learn
or be surprised about it in a repeated game. It will also allow them to improve the
value of information under uncertainty. It is proposed as a possible solution for the
problem of utility induction in game-theoretic settings that include uncertainty over
outcomes. 

This solution will return the set of corrlated equilibria and its polytope, given the provided lower and upper previsions of the uncertain outcome. 

Please use Simulation.py for examples. More detailed documentation will be provided in the future.
